What is EBS?
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances in AWS. It is like a virtual hard drive that you can attach to your EC2 instance.
Data stored in EBS volumes persists even after the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated, unless the volume is manually deleted.

Uses of EBS
•	Persistent Storage: Store data that should survive instance termination.
•	Databases: Perfect for databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
•	Boot Volumes: Used as root volumes for EC2 instances.
•	Backup and Recovery: Take snapshots of volumes for backup.

When to Use EBS in Real Time
•	When your application needs persistent storage beyond the lifecycle of an EC2 instance.
•	When you need scalable storage with high availability.
•	For databases or transactional applications where low-latency access is required.
•	When you want snapshots to back up critical data.

How to Create an EBS Volume
1.	Go to the AWS Management Console → EC2 → Volumes.
2.	Click Create Volume.
3.	Select Volume Type (General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS, etc.).
4.	Specify Size (e.g., 20 GB).
5.	Select the Availability Zone (important note: it must match the EC2 instance’s AZ).
6.	Click Create Volume.

How to Attach EBS to an EC2 Instance
1.	Go to EC2 → Volumes, select the volume.
2.	Click Actions → Attach Volume.
3.	Select the Instance you want to attach it to.
4.	Specify a Device Name (e.g., /dev/sdf).
5.	Click Attach

Important Notes:
•	EBS volumes can only be attached to EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone.
•	You cannot attach a volume to an instance in a different region. To use it in another region, you must take a snapshot and create a new volume from the snapshot in the target region.
