                      Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
What is an AMI?
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a blueprint of an EC2 instance that includes:
Operating System
Configurations
Installed applications and dependencies

Why do we use AMIs?
Standardization → Instead of manually configuring each server, we create a reusable AMI with all required dependencies. Every new instance launched from this AMI is identical.
Faster Recovery → If a production server fails, we don’t waste time reinstalling apps. We just launch a new instance from the AMI and it’s ready to go.
Scaling → Auto Scaling Groups use AMIs to ensure every new instance comes up pre-configured and ready to serve traffic.
Compliance & Security → “Golden AMIs” are created with the latest patches and compliance requirements, ensuring all servers meet organizational standards.

How to use AMIs?
Launch a new EC2 instance.
Configure it with OS, software, and settings.
Create an AMI from this instance (via AWS Console or CLI).
Use that AMI to launch new EC2 instances with the same configuration.


                               Launch Template

What is a Launch Template?
An AWS Launch Template is a configuration blueprint that defines how an EC2 instance should be launched.
It can include details like:
AMI ID
Instance type
Networking (VPC, Subnet, Security Groups)
Storage (EBS volumes)
Key pair, IAM role, tags, etc.

Why do DevOps Engineers use Launch Templates?
Consistency → Ensure all EC2 instances (in Auto Scaling Groups or manually launched) follow the same configuration.
Automation → Useful for Infrastructure-as-Code pipelines where EC2 instances are created automatically.
Version Control → Launch Templates support versions, so changes can be tracked, tested, and rolled back if needed.
Scalability → Simplifies Auto Scaling setups by having all settings pre-defined.
Cost Optimization → Multiple instance types or purchase options (On-demand, Spot) can be defined in the same template for flexibility.

How to use Launch Templates?
In AWS Console, go to EC2 → Launch Templates.
Create a new template with details like AMI, instance type, networking, security groups.
Launch instances directly from this template, or attach it to an Auto Scaling Group.
