# Introduction to AWS

1. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing provides services like storage, servers, and databases over the internet, so we can focus on building applications instead of managing physical servers.

2. Why Use Cloud?
- Scalable resources on-demand
- Cost-effective: pay only for what you use
- Global accessibility
- High availability and reliability

3. Benefits of AWS Cloud
- Wide range of services (compute, storage, databases, ML, etc.)
- Security and compliance
- Flexibility & scalability
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model

4. Difference Between On-Premises and AWS Cloud
             On-Premises:                                                                                    
•	Infrastructure: Managed by you
•	Scalability: Limited, requires manual scaling
•	Cost: High upfront costs
•	Maintenance: Your responsibility
•	Availability: Depends on your setup


             AWS Cloud:
•	Infrastructure: Managed by AWS
•	Scalability: Automatic, on-demand
•	Cost: Pay-as-you-go
•	Maintenance: AWS handles underlying infrastructure
•	Availability: High availability built-in
