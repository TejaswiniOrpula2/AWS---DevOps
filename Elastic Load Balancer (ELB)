What is ELB?
An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, containers, or IPs.
It ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability by routing requests only to healthy targets.

Why do we use ELB?
High Availability → Distributes traffic across multiple instances/zones to avoid downtime.
Scalability → Handles traffic spikes by balancing requests dynamically.
Fault Tolerance → If one instance fails, traffic is redirected to healthy ones.
Security → Works with SSL/TLS for encrypted traffic

Real-time Usage?
Web Applications → Balance user traffic between multiple app servers.
Microservices → Distribute API calls across containers/services
Auto Scaling → Automatically routes traffic to new instances added by Auto Scaling Groups.
Zero-downtime Deployments → Use target group draining for safe rolling updates.

How to Create an ELB (from scratch)?
Go to EC2 Dashboard → Load Balancers → Create Load Balancer
Choose the type:
Application Load Balancer (Layer 7, HTTP/HTTPS)
Network Load Balancer (Layer 4, TCP/UDP)
Gateway Load Balancer (used for appliances like firewalls)
Configure basic settings: Name, scheme (internet-facing/internal), VPC, subnets.
Add security groups (firewall rules).
Configure listeners (ports):
     HTTP → 80
     HTTPS → 443
Create a Target Group (EC2 instances/containers/IPs).
Register targets (instances to receive traffic).
Review & create → ELB will start routing traffic.

Key Health Check Concepts in ELB?
Healthy → Instance passed the health check (can receive traffic).
Unhealthy → Instance failed health checks (no traffic sent).
Unused → Instance not registered in the target group, so it’s ignored by ELB.
Draining → Instance is being deregistered; ELB stops sending new traffic but allows in-progress requests to finish (used during deployments).
Threshold → Number of consecutive successes/failures required before marking an instance as healthy/unhealthy.
Unhealthy Time Limit → Time taken before ELB decides an instance is unhealthy (depends on health check interval × unhealthy threshold).
